<h1>Temi Robot Android Project</h1>

With cooperation with (주)클로봇 Company, our team created an Android Application for people to interact with the robot.

With the given SDK, the mobile robot can be controlled and move to designated places with JAVA.

For this project, Spotify API for both Python and Java were used. Also AWS Python Server was used for socket communication with arduino/robot.
